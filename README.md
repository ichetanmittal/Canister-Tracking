# `canister-tracking-platform`

A platform for tracking and managing Internet Computer canisters, monitoring their cycles, memory usage, and performance metrics.

## Live Deployment

The application is deployed on the Internet Computer mainnet and can be accessed at:
- Frontend URL: https://4tutm-pyaaa-aaaag-at2ta-cai.icp0.io/

### Deployed Canisters
- Backend Canister: `42xyq-zqaaa-aaaag-at2sq-cai`
  - Candid Interface: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=42xyq-zqaaa-aaaag-at2sq-cai
- Frontend Canister: `4tutm-pyaaa-aaaag-at2ta-cai`

## Features
- Register and track multiple canisters
- Monitor cycles consumption
- Track memory usage
- View performance metrics
- Secure authentication using Internet Identity

## Development

### Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

### Frontend Development

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This is recommended before starting the frontend development server and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

For frontend development, start the development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Deployment

To deploy to the Internet Computer mainnet:

1. Ensure you have sufficient ICP tokens and cycles
2. Configure your identity:
   ```bash
   dfx identity use <your-identity>
   ```
3. Deploy to mainnet:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network ic
   ```

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- Use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
